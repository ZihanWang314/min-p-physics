# When the World Collapses: The Rule of Physics may use min_p as a Regularization

This paper proposes that the universe maintains stability through mechanisms similar to min-p regularization in machine learning.

## Core Theory

Low-probability catastrophic events ("Catales") should occur given infinite time:
```
lim(t→∞) (1 - (1-p)^t) = 1
```

We propose that the universe employs min-p regularization:
```
p_event < min_p · (1-p_event) ⟹ p_event = 0
```

This explains:
- Absence of macroscopic quantum effects
- Evolutionary fitness thresholds
- Stability of physical constants
